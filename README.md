# Let_LLMs_talk
#### CSCI 4907.82 Natural Language Understanding Final Project, Spring 2024
In the final project, we attempt to replicate "Let the LLMs Talk: Simulating Human-to-Human Conversational QA via Zero-Shot LLM-to-LLM Interactions" (link to paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.02913). We implement two LLMs using acting as a student (questioner) and teacher (answerer) to explore if this can be a novel and efficient way to improve upon intearctive search systems which currently employ human annotators. We use LLaMA3 in one instance and GPT-4 in another.
